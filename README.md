# Principal_Components_Analysi_PCA

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is an exploratory technique that interacts with metric variables that share considerable correlation values amongst themselves. The primary goal of this technique is to establish new variables or "factors" that encapsulate the joint behavior of the original variables.

In essence, PCA is employed to identify a smaller number of uncorrelated variables, known as "principal components" from a large set of data. The transformation to these new uncorrelated variables retains most of the variation present in the original data.

Therefore, PCA can be understood as a technique that seeks to group variables based on previously established criteria. It is widely used in areas like face recognition, computer vision, and many others where data dimensionality reduction is a critical step.

Importantly, PCA allows us to interpret the underlying structure of the data in a way that best explains the variance in the data. By reducing the number of variables, it becomes easier to understand, visualize, and further analyze the data, providing invaluable insights.
